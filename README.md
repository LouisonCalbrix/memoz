The Game
==========

### Description

Memoz is a super simple game where you need to use your short-term memory. A game of Memoz goes like this:
* At first, you are shawn, during a very limited time, a grid containing two types of tiles, tiles with a cross and tiles with a bright round. You need to remember where the tiles with a round are located.
* Then all the tiles turn blue.
* Now you need to click on tiles that had a round, be careful as you don't have unlimited tries.  

That's it! Pretty easy, right?
