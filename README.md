___
### What are the rules of the game of Memoz?
* At first, you are shawn, during a very limited time, a grid containing two types of tiles, let's say there are red and blue tiles. You need to remember where the red tiles are located.
* Then all the tiles turn blue.
* Now you need to click on tiles that were red, be careful as you don't have unlimited tries.
That's it! Pretty easy, right?
