# memoz
# A game where you need to use your short-term memory.
# The player is shown a grid made of tiles, most of them are blue and some
# of them are red. The player must remember where the red tiles are because,
# after a while, all the tiles are flipped and it is not possible to see which
# ones are red and which ones are blue. At that point, the player's goal is to
# click on the tiles that are red to get points, and since he doesn't have  
# unlimited tries he must choose wisely!

    A Tile is a square that is either a target or not. The player must memorise
    the location of Tiles that are targets. When a Tile's _revealed attribute
    is True it is displayed so that we can differentiate between a target Tile
    and a non target one, when _revealed is False all the Tiles look the same.
